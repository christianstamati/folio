            Choosing the perfect wedding suit presents several challenges,
            including the need to match the fabric and style to the wedding
            season and venue, navigating the overwhelming array of fabric
            options with varying textures, weights, and appearances, and dealing
            with the limited availability of fabrics in physical stores due to
            space constraints.

            Most online configuration solutions utilize WebGL-based engines for
            showcasing meshes and materials. One popular library is three.js,
            known for its massive community support and open-source nature.
            WebGL libraries render directly on the userâ€™s device, resulting in
            instant loading times. However, we sought a different approach to
            achieve higher quality: Cloud Streaming.
          </p>
          <VerticalSpace size={"sm"} />
          <p>
            By leveraging cloud streaming technology, we built a standalone
            Windows application that runs on powerful devices and serves the
            rendering to low-budget devices. While this approach introduces
            challenges such as longer loading times and dependence on internet
            connection speed, the superior quality of the final product
            justified the risks.

              We created an Unreal Engine project where all the meshes and
              materials, crafted by Riccardo and Vasco, are meticulously set up.
              By integrating these assets into the Variant Manager, we enable
              seamless interaction between the client and the application. This
              setup allows for multiple mesh and fabric variants, offering
              endless possibilities for customization.

              personalized outfit recommendations for them to begin customizing.
              Additionally, this approach allows us to optimize the user
              experience by initiating the Unreal Engine virtual machine in the

            Instead of reinventing the wheel, we utilized Unreal Engine&apos;s
            built-in Variant Manager. This tool allows for creating variants and
            assigning properties to in-scene actors. Selecting a particular
            variant changes the state of the actor in the scene, simplifying the
            configuration process. Through extensive tests and research with the
            Variant Manager, we created a functional prototype in Unreal Engine.

            excited about the results. After weeks of monitoring, we achieved
            our most important goal: increasing website visitors. Despite the
            startup time of the solution being around 2 minutes, most users
            stayed on the platform and engaged with the experience. A small
            percentage did not wait for the experience to load, which is a
            technological constraint we plan to address in the future by
            improving startup times.

            In this project, I integrated Unreal Engine and Next.js with cloud
            streaming, which was an amazing learning opportunity where I
            acquired skills in Tailwind and Next.js, among others. However, if
            given another chance, I would approach several aspects differently:
            I would better distinguish between server and client components,
            avoiding unnecessary &quot;use client&quot; directives; improve page
            structure by moving some logic to the layout page for better
            organization; and utilize component libraries like shadcn for a more
            consistent look and feel. Despite these challenges, the project was
            immensely rewarding and helped me unlock a new, valuable skill set
            for the future.
